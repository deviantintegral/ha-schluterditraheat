# Schluter DITRA-HEAT

A custom [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration for [Schluter DITRA-HEAT](https://www.schluter.com/schluter-us/en_US/ditra-heat) WiFi floor heating thermostats that use the [schluterditraheat.com](https://schluterditraheat.com) cloud service.

## Compatibility

Schluter has multiple apps and cloud platforms for different product lines. This integration works with thermostats managed through the **Schluter Smart Thermostat** app and [schluterditraheat.com](https://schluterditraheat.com) — **not** the older Schluter DITRA-HEAT app or other Schluter platforms. If you can log in at [schluterditraheat.com](https://schluterditraheat.com) with your credentials, this integration should work for you.

Tested with the **DITRA-HEAT-E-RS1** thermostat. Other models using the same cloud service should work but have not been verified. If you encounter issues with a different model, please [open an issue](https://github.com/KevinFarrell/ha-schluterditraheat/issues).

## Features

- **Climate entity** — control temperature and mode (Auto, Heat/Manual, Off) per thermostat, plus a frost protection preset
- **Heating output sensor** — track heating output percentage with history graphs and long-term statistics
- **Power sensor** — instantaneous power draw (watts) of the connected heating load
- **Energy dashboard** — hourly energy consumption imported into long-term statistics, including backfilled history, for use in the Home Assistant Energy dashboard
- **GFCI fault sensor** — binary sensor for ground fault detection, enabling safety automations
- **Wi-Fi signal sensor** — diagnostic sensor reporting signal strength in dBm
- **Device metadata** — model, software and hardware version, and serial number on the device page

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click the three dots menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/KevinFarrell/ha-schluterditraheat` with category **Integration**
4. Search for "Schluter DITRA-HEAT" and install
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for "Schluter DITRA-HEAT"

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/schluterditraheat/` directory to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and search for "Schluter DITRA-HEAT"

## Configuration

Enter your [schluterditraheat.com](https://schluterditraheat.com) account credentials when prompted by the config flow. All thermostats on your account will be discovered automatically.

**Note:** Adding or removing thermostats from your Schluter account requires reloading the integration in Home Assistant.

## Entities

Each thermostat creates the following entities, grouped under a single device:

| Entity | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Floor Heat | Climate | Temperature control and mode selection |
| Heating Output | Sensor | Current heating output percentage (0–100%) |
| Power | Sensor | Instantaneous power draw in watts (connected load × heating output) |
| GFCI Status | Binary Sensor | Ground fault detection (problem device class) |
| Wi-Fi Signal | Sensor | Signal strength in dBm (diagnostic) |

The device page also shows the model, software version, hardware version and serial number reported by the thermostat.

The web app renders the same Wi-Fi reading as a five-level scale (amazing, very good, okay, weak, very weak). The API returns the underlying dBm value, which is what this integration exposes; use a template sensor if you want the bucketed wording.

In addition, each thermostat's hourly energy consumption is imported into Home Assistant's long-term statistics (as an external statistic, in kWh) so it can be added to the **Energy dashboard**. When first set up, available historical hours are backfilled; the statistic then refreshes hourly.

> **Note:** The thermostat reports energy per hour, not a continuously increasing meter reading, so energy appears as an Energy-dashboard statistic rather than a regular sensor entity. Add it via **Settings → Dashboards → Energy → Add consumption**, where it is listed as `Schluter DITRA-HEAT` energy for each thermostat.

## Polling and rate limits

The thermostat's cloud backend enforces request limits and publishes its remaining budget in `X-RateLimit-*` response headers on every call. This integration:

- Polls every **300 seconds** by default, the minimum cadence the backend's OEM (Sinopé) asks integrators to respect. (Static data such as device lists is refreshed roughly hourly; the fast path only fetches thermostat state.)
- Reads the rate-limit headers on every response and **defers the next poll** automatically when the remaining budget runs low, resuming normal cadence once it recovers.
- Recognizes the backend's JSON error codes (which it returns instead of HTTP 429): a daily-cap hit (`ACCDAYREQMAX`) pauses polling until midnight, an expired session (`USRSESSEXP`) re-authenticates transparently, and login/session limits are surfaced clearly.

## Limitations

This integration supports monitoring and basic control. The following are **not** currently supported:

- Managing or editing heating schedules (schedules configured in the Schluter app are respected in Auto mode)
- Changing the air/floor sensor mode
- Firmware updates
- Adding or removing thermostats (requires reloading the integration)

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Schluter Systems. It uses the existing schluterditraheat.com web APIs, which are undocumented and may change at any time. If the APIs change, this integration may break until it is updated.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1 or later
- A Schluter DITRA-HEAT WiFi thermostat with a [schluterditraheat.com](https://schluterditraheat.com) account
